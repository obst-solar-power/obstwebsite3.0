                As more Nigerians embrace solar energy, understanding how much electricity your solar panels are producing becomes essential. Solar power is a
                sustainable solution to Nigeria's erratic power supply, but to truly benefit from your system, you need to monitor its performance. Here's a
                simple guide on how to calculate the electricity your solar panels generate, ensuring you get the most out of your investment.

                  <b>Determine the Solar Panel Wattage</b>
                  <p>
                    Each solar panel has a specific wattage. For example, if your solar panel is rated at 300 watts (W), this is the maximum amount of
                    electricity it can produce under ideal conditions.

                  <p class="mt-2">
                    Nigeria has good solar potential, with an average of 4–6 peak sunlight hours per day. Peak sunlight hours refer to the time when the sun's
                    rays are strong enough to produce maximum energy. If you live in northern Nigeria, you might receive closer to 6 hours, while southern
                    regions may get around 4 hours.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Use the Formula: Solar Power Output (kWh) = Solar Panel Wattage × Peak Sunlight Hours × Number of Panels</b>
                  <p>Let’s break it down with an example:</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
                    <li>You have a 300W solar panel.</li>
                    <li>You receive an average of 5 hours of peak sunlight daily.</li>
                    <li>You have 10 solar panels installed.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="my-3 space-y-4">
                    <p>The daily electricity output is calculated as:</p>
                    <code class="bg-gray-500/10 px-5 py-2 rounded-lg block w-fit"> 300W × 5 hours × 10 panels = 15,000 watt-hours or 15 kWh/day </code>
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Account for Panels Efficiency</b>
                  <p>
                    No system is 100% efficient. Panels, for instance, typically operate at about 75% efficiency. To get a more accurate estimate of the amount
                    of usuable energy generated, multiply your result by the efficiency of your panels.
                  </p>
                  <div class="my-3 space-y-4">
                    <p>Using the previous example:</p>
                    <code class="bg-gray-500/10 px-5 py-2 rounded-lg block w-fit"> 15 kWh/day × 0.75 (75% efficiency) = 11.3 kWh/day </code>
                  </div>
                  So, with % 75% Panel efficiency, your panels produces 11.3 kWh of usable electricity daily, which can be stored in the battery for later or
                  used directly through the inverter.
